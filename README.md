# SMART-FARMING
This is a project that we do in the Multidisciplinary Project 2023
## Description
* The "Smart Farm" system is a model that uses electronic devices and information technology to easily manage and monitor activities on the farm, including monitoring ambient temperature, soil moisture, helping farmers control the quality and yield of crops.
* The devices used in the smart farm include sensors, remote control devices remote, data storage system. Sensors are used to monitor temperature, humidity, light, and   other environmental factors on the farm. Remote control device allows users to adjust remote farm environmental parameters, including watering, temperature and humidity changes. System data storage helps the user to monitor the parameters of the environment and activities on the farm, for enable them to evaluate the effectiveness of their operations and thereby make decisions to improve production in future.
* Using equipment in smart farms will help reduce costs and increase production efficiency as well such as increasing accuracy and ease in managing operations on the farm
